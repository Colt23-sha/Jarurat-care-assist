# Jarurat Care Assist – Mini Healthcare Support Web App

## Project Overview
Jarurat Care Assist is a **concept-level healthcare support web application** designed for NGOs.  
It provides a simple way for patients or volunteers to submit healthcare-related requests and receive instant feedback.

The project focuses on **clarity, usability, and basic automation**, rather than full-scale backend complexity.

## Features
- Patient / Volunteer support form
- Request categorization (Medicine, Doctor, Emergency, Other)
- Instant auto-response after form submission
- Basic automation to detect **emergency requests**
- Clean and responsive UI

## Tech Stack
- **HTML** – Structure and form layout  
- **CSS** – Styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** – Form handling and automation logic  
- **Netlify** – Live hosting 

## AI / Automation Idea
This project uses **basic automation logic** to simulate an AI-powered system.

- User messages are analyzed using keyword-based logic
- Requests containing words like *urgent, emergency, pain, blood* are marked as **high priority**
- Emergency requests receive a different auto-response message

This demonstrates how NGOs can use simple automation to **prioritize critical healthcare cases quickly**.

## NGO Use Case
Jarurat Care can use this application to:
- Collect healthcare support requests from patients
- Register volunteers willing to help
- Identify emergency cases faster
- Reduce manual effort in request triaging

This concept can later be extended with real AI models, databases, and admin dashboards.
